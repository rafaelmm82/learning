# Notes on Exploratory Data Analysis chapter
# -----------------------------------------

# To apply the statistical concepts covered in this book, unstructured raw 
# data must be processed and manipulated into a structured form.
# One of the commonest forms of structured data is a table with rows and 
# columnsâ€”as data might emerge from a relational database or be collected 
# for a study.

# Types of data: 
# Unstructured data: raw data that has not been processed into a table.
# Structured data: data that has been processed into a table.
# - Numerical (continuous or discrete), 
# - Categorical (fixed set, binary [true/false], ordinal)
